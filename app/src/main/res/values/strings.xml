        Thank you for downloading my app. My intention\n
        is for this to be a companion to other forms of\n
        therapy. Like many people across the world, I\'ve\n
        struggled with varying degrees of depression and\n
        anxiety and often feel myself getting to my lowest\n
        points in the middle of long shifts at work or doing\n
        daily tasks. I decided to make this to provide\n
        motivational support here and there. Every little bit\n
        helps and I hope for others out there like me, this\n
        little bit can provide some measure of comfort.\n\n
        -Daniel
