    <string name="about_string">
        Thank you for downloading my app. My intention is for
        this to be a small companion to other sorts of therapy,
        as well as being some practice for me as a new developer.
        I\'ve struggled with varying levels of mental illness since
        I was a young child and understand how sometimes you just
        something small to help get you through your day (or night).
        As silly as it sounds, sometimes reading some motivational
        quotes would help pull me out of down periods. My hope is
        that this app can do that for you.\n\n
        -Daniel
