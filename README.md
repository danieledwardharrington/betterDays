# Better Days: A Wellness Companion

The idea here is for this app to a companion to CBT therapy. So many of the apps on the market right now can be bloated and intimidating for some. They seek to be the therapy rather than assist it. This app is aimed at being simple, approachable, and lightweight.

# Functionality

Functionality here is simple. The user selects how many notifications they want per day and the app generates random times. At those times, the notification content is an inspirational or motivational quote. For now, I limited the number of notifications to 8. Users are also able to change what background image they want from five options. I'm using an AlarmManager here to set the times.

# Stylistic Notes

I took a lot of inspiration from Boost, my favorite Android app for Reddit. I didn't implement any kind of light theme, but it's something I might do if it's requested.
